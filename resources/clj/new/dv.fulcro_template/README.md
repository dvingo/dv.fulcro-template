# Prerequisites

This template utilizes GNU Make 4.x. You'll need to install it first 
before executing `make`.

This template uses `yarn` to handle npm dependencies.

# Start dev

## Shadow cljs tasks

In one terminal:

```bash
# If you use nvm, if not see .nvmrc for the expected node.js version
nvm use
make
```
this runs `yarn install` and starts the shadow-cljs watch processes.

Please see the `shadow-cljs.edn` file for ports used for development builds.

If any of those ports are used already shadow-cljs will try different ports so please see the console output 
by shadow-cljs.

{{#server?}}
When the main build is complete, start the backend server either in an editor or at the command line.

The clj server reads the manifest file produced by shadow-cljs so the build must complete before you start the server.
{{/server?}}

## Editor setup

In your editor:
add 2 repls:

### frontend repl:

nREPL remote:

  localhost:$port
  
The $port defaults to 9000 but may be different if 9000 is already in use.

Using this repl you connect to the various ClojureScript builds using `(shadow/repl :build-id)`

{{#server?}}
### backend repl:

nREPL local

enable these deps aliases: dev, test, guardrails

start backend repl, then:

```clojure
(start) ;; (user/start)
```
This uses mount to start the web server.

_note_ you do not need to specify any JVM parameters.

You can start this on the command line via:

```clojure
make be-repl
```

## Clojure webserver.

The clojure webserver listens on port 8085 by default - this is specified in `src/main/config/defaults.edn`

http://localhost:8085

# Production server build

All builds are handled by tasks in the Makefile.


Both frontend and backend builds:
```bash
make prod-build
```

Server jar only:

```bash
make be-release
```

Run the prod server:
```bash
make start-prod-server
```
{{/server?}}

{{#workspaces?}}
## Workspaces
Workspaces are available at:

http://127.0.0.1:8023

Again, the port may be different if 8023 is already in use.
{{/workspaces?}}

{{#devcards?}}
## Devcards
Devcards are available at:

http://127.0.0.1:4001
{{/devcards?}}

{{#node-server?}}
# Node.js server

Start the server with:
```bash
./scripts/start_node_server.sh
```

When the server is started you can connect a cljs repl using:

```clojure
(shadow/repl :node-server)
```
{{/node-server?}}
